    <h2>History</h2>
        <img src="images/history.jpg" alt="Happy Client" class="history-img">
        <p>Wild Waters Rafting was established in 2010 by a group of passionate river enthusiasts who sought to share their love for the 
            great outdoors and the thrill of navigating wild waters. The founders, two childhood friends and a seasoned river guide, met 
            during a summer rafting trip. Inspired by their shared experiences and the breathtaking beauty of nature, 
            they decided to create a company that would offer unforgettable adventures for everyone, from novices to seasoned paddlers.
            What started as a small operation with a few rafts and local trips quickly gained popularity. Word-of-mouth referrals and rave 
            reviews led to expanded offerings, including multi-day expeditions, family-friendly floats, and team-building corporate events. 
            Wild Waters Rafting became known for its knowledgeable guides, top-notch safety protocols, and commitment to customer satisfaction.
            As the company grew, so did its involvement in the local community
            Wild Waters Rafting organizes annual river clean-up events, 
            educational workshops, and partnerships with environmental organizations to protect 
            the waterways they cherish. They believe in giving back and ensuring that future generations can enjoy the same thrilling adventures.
            Today, Wild Waters Rafting is a beloved local institution, renowned for its commitment to adventure, safety, and sustainability. 
            With a fleet of state-of-the-art rafts and a team of experienced guides, they continue to lead unforgettable journeys through 
            some of the most stunning rivers in the region. 
            Whether navigating class IV rapids or enjoying a tranquil float, participants leave with memories that last a lifetime.</p>
