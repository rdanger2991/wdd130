    <p>Port-au-Prince is the capital and largest city of Haiti, located on the country's western coast along the Gulf of GonÃ¢ve. 
        It serves as Haitiâ€™s economic, cultural, and political center. Known for its vibrant, bustling streets, Port-au-Prince has 
        a rich history and is home to a diverse population. 
        The city is a mix of colonial architecture, modern buildings, and informal housing, with notable landmarks like the National 
        Palace, the Iron Market (MarchÃ© en Fer), and the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Assumption. The culture of Port-au-Prince is 
        shaped by its French colonial heritage and African influences, seen in its art, music, and vibrant local markets.Despite facing 
        challenges like poverty, natural disasters (notably the 2010 earthquake), and political instability, Port-au-Prince is known 
        for its resilience. Itâ€™s also a hub for Haitian art, including the famous "tap-tap" buses, brightly painted public transport 
        vehicles, and the cityâ€™s thriving art scene, especially in areas like the Croix-des-Bouquets. The cityâ€™s location gives it 
        access to scenic views of the surrounding hills and the Caribbean Sea, with a tropical climate that brings warmth year-round.</p>
